						<h1> Amazon </h1>
						<p> Amazon Rainforest, large tropical rainforest occupying the drainage basin of the Amazon River and its tributaries in northern South America and 
						covering an area of 6,000,000 square km. Comprising about 40 percent of Brazil’s total area, it is bounded by the Guiana Highlands
						to the north, the Andes Mountains to the west, the Brazilian central plateau to the south, and the Atlantic Ocean to the east. Amazonia is the largest river 
						basin in the world, and its forest stretches from the Atlantic Ocean in the east to the tree line of the Andes in the west. The forest widens from a 
						320-km front along the Atlantic to a belt 1,900 km wide where the lowlands meet the Andean foothills. The immense extent and great continuity
						of this rainforest is a reflection of the high rainfall, high humidity, and monotonously high temperatures that prevail in the region. The Amazon Rainforest
						is the world’s richest and most-varied biological reservoir, containing several million species of insects, plants, birds, and other forms of life, many 
						still unrecorded by science. Major wildlife includes jaguar, anaconda, poison frog, amazon river dolphin, macaw parrots, toucan, sloths and several types of monkeys.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div id="sl1">
					
					</div>
					<div class="dole">
						<p>The basin is drained by the Amazon River, the world's largest river in terms of discharge, and the second longest river in the world after the Nile.
						Recent geological studies suggest that for millions of years the Amazon River used to flow in the opposite direction - from east to west. Eventually the Andes Mountains formed, 
						blocking its flow to the Pacific Ocean, and causing it to switch directions to its current mouth in the Atlantic Ocean.						
						In the 20th century, Brazil’s rapidly growing population settled major areas of the Amazon Rainforest. The size of the Amazon forest shrank dramatically
						as a result of settlers clearance of the land to obtain lumber and to create grazing pastures and farmland. Brazil holds approximately 60 percent of the 
						Amazon basin within its borders. The amount of forest cover declined to some 3,323,000 square km by 2016, about 81 percent of the 
						area that had been covered by forests in 1970. In the 1990s the Brazilian government and various international bodies began efforts to protect parts of the 
						forest from human encroachment, exploitation, deforestation, and other forms of destruction. Although Brazil’s Amazon continues to lose forest cover, 
						the pace of this loss declined from roughly 0.4 percent per year during the 1980s and ’90s to roughly 0.1–0.2 percent per year between 2008 and 2016. 
						However, some 75,000 fires occurred in the Brazilian Amazon during the first half of 2019 (an increase of 85 percent over 2018).

						<h1> Jaguar </h1>
						<p> Jaguar, (Panthera onca), largest New World member of the cat family (Felidae), found from northern Mexico southward to northern Argentina.
						Its preferred habitats are usually swamps and wooded regions, but jaguars also live in scrublands and deserts. The jaguar is virtually extinct 
						in the northern part of its original range and survives in reduced numbers only in remote areas of Central and South America; the largest known
						population exists in the Amazon rainforest.
						Typical coloration is orange to tan, with black spots arranged in rosettes with a black spot in the centre. The jaguar resembles the 
						leopard of Africa and Asia, but the leopard lacks the black centre spot. Along the midline of the jaguar’s back is a row of long black spots
						that may merge into a stripe. The base colour of the jaguar varies greatly from white to black. Although brown and black jaguars appear to be 
						solid-coloured, spots are always faintly visible.
						Jaguars are also larger and more heavily built than leopards. The male jaguar, which is generally larger than the female, attains a 
						length of 1.7–2.7 metres (5.6–9 feet), including the 0.6–0.9-metre (2–3-foot) tail, with a shoulder height of 0.7–0.8 metre (2.3–2.6 feet);
						it weighs from 100 to 160 kg (220 to 350 pounds). South American jaguars are 
						</p>
					</div>
					<div id="sl2">
					
					</div>
					<div class="dole">
						<p> larger than those of Central America. A solitary predator, the jaguar is a stalk-and-ambush hunter; its name comes from yaguar, the Tupí-Guaraní word 
						meaning “he who kills with one leap.” Jaguars are swift and agile and are very good climbers. They enter water freely and appear to enjoy bathing. 
						Although active during the day, jaguars hunt mainly at night and on the ground. Capybara and peccary are their preferred prey, but they will also 
						take deer, birds, crocodilians, and fish. Livestock are occasionally attacked in areas where ranches have replaced natural habitat. The cat is a 
						savage fighter when cornered but does not normally attack humans.Jaguars adhere to a land tenure system much like cougars and tigers. Females 
						establish overlapping home ranges, and female offspring may inherit land from their mothers. Males establish territories twice as large as females
						and overlap the ranges of several females. The mother raises the young for
						approximately two years.
						The geographic range of the jaguar once extended from the U.S.-Mexico border as far north as the Grand Canyon southward 
						to Patagonia, Argentina. Habitat loss and fragmentation, trophy hunting, the illegal trade in body parts, and retaliatory 
						killings stemming from the loss of livestock have reduced the jaguar’s geographic range and its population. Wildlife officials
						estimate that 64,000 jaguars remain, with some 89 percent of the global population living in the Amazon River basin.

						<h1>Anaconda</h1>
						<p>Anaconda, either of two species of constricting, water-loving snakes found in tropical South America. 
						The green anaconda, also called the giant anaconda is an olive-coloured snake with 
						alternating oval-shaped black spots. The yellow, or southern, anaconda is much smaller and has pairs of overlapping spots. 
						Green anacondas live along tropical waters east of the Andes Mountains and on the Caribbean island of Trinidad. The green anaconda is the 
						largest snake in the world. Although anacondas and pythons both have been reliably measured at over 9 metres long, anacondas have been 
						reported to measure over 10 metres and are much more heavily built. Most individuals, however, do not exceed 5 metres.
						Green anacondas lie in the water (generally at night) to ambush caimans and mammals such as capybara, deer, tapirs, and peccaries that come to drink.
						An anaconda seizes a large animal by the neck and almost instantly throws its coils around it, killing it by constriction. Anacondas kill smaller prey, 
						such as small turtles and diving birds, with the mouth and sharp backward-pointing teeth alone. Kills made onshore are often dragged into the water, 
						perhaps to avoid attracting jaguars and to ward off biting ants attracted to the carcass.
					</div>
					<div id="sl3">
					
					</div>
					<div class="dole">
						<p>The green anaconda is the world's heaviest and one of the world's longest snakes, reaching a length of up to 5.21 m long.
						More typical mature specimens reportedly can range up to 5 m, with adult females, with a mean length of about 4.6 m,
						being generally much larger than the males, which average around 3 m. Weights are less well studied, though reportedly range
						from 30 to 80 kg in a typical adult. It is the largest snake native to the Americas. Although it is slightly shorter than 
						the reticulated python, it is far bulkier; the bulk of a 5.2-metre green anaconda is comparable to that of a 7.4-metre 
						reticulated python.The remote location of the snake's habitat has historically made locating, capturing, and returning specimens difficult. 
						Transporting very large specimens to museums, especially before substantial decay, is difficult 
						(though this has not prevented the return of much larger and more cumbersome crocodilian specimens).
						Skins can stretch substantially, increasing the snake's size by more than 50% if stretched during the tanning process. 
						Anacondas are mostly nocturnal and aquatic. They float underwater and can swim fast. 
						Their eyes and nose are located on the top of the head, allowing the snake to breathe and watch for prey while the rest of the body is hidden underwater.
						When prey passes by or stops to drink, the anaconda strikes (without eating or swallowing it) and coils around it with its body then constricts and 
						suffocates the prey to death.

						<h1>Poison frog</h1>
						<p>Poison frog, (family Dendrobatidae), any of approximately 180 species of New World frogs characterized by the ability to produce 
						extremely poisonous skin secretions. Poison frogs inhabit the forests of the New World tropics from Nicaragua to Peru and Brazil, and 
						a few species are used by South American tribes to coat the tips of darts and arrows. All frogs (order Anura) produce poisonous skin secretions;
						however, humans do not notice the toxicity or suffer skin irritation when handling most species. Nonetheless, 
						handling one of the brightly coloured dendrobatids, such as Dendrobates and Phyllobates, requires caution because their
						alkaloid skin secretions are potentially lethal if absorbed through human mucous membranes or passed into the body through a
						cut on the skin. In fact, the skin secretion of the true poison dart frog, or golden poison frog (Phyllobates terribilis), is
						so toxic that the tip of a dart rubbed across its back picks up sufficient poison to kill a large bird or a monkey. The origin 
						and production of the toxic skin secretions remains uncertain, but at least in some dendrobatids it appears to be derived from their
						consumption of beetles, their primary prey. 
					</div>
					<div id="sl4">
					
					</div>
					<div class="dole">
						<p>Most species of poison dart frogs are small, sometimes less than 1.5 cm in adult length, although a few grow up to 6 cm 
						in length. They weigh 1 oz. on average.Most poison dart frogs are brightly colored, displaying aposematic patterns to warn potential predators.
						Warning coloration is common among distasteful and poisonous species of many plants and animals. The coloration of poison frogs 
						commonly includes reds, oranges, yellows, and even bright blues and greens on a black or dark background. Not all dendrobatids are so 
						poisonous or brightly coloured; many are patterned with shades of brown and well camouflaged (as in Colostethus), and their skin secretions 
						are generally nontoxic and nonirritating. Parental care of the young, which is often performed by the male, occurs in all poison frog species. 
						The male attracts a female to his residence beneath a leaf or log, and she lays the eggs and often departs. The male remains to guard the clutch;
						however, in some species the female remains. When the tadpoles hatch, the parent allows the tadpoles to swim or crawl up onto his or her back. 
						They are subsequently carried to a nearby body of water (such as a stream, a pond, or a tree hole). There, the tadpoles slide off the back of the
						parent and into the water to complete their development.

						<h1>Amazon river dolphin</h1>
						<p>The Amazon river dolphin (Inia geoffrensis), also known as the boto, bufeo or pink river dolphin, is a species of toothed whale endemic to
						South America and is classified in the family Iniidae. Three subspecies are currently recognized: I. g. geoffrensis (Amazon river dolphin),
						boliviensis (Bolivian river dolphin) and humboldtiana (Orinoco river dolphin) while position of Araguaian river dolphin (I. araguaiaensis) 
						within the clade is still unclear. The three subspecies are distributed in the Amazon basin, the upper Madeira River in Bolivia, and the
						Orinoco basin, respectively.
						The Amazon river dolphin is the largest species of river dolphin, with adult males reaching 185 kilograms  in weight, and 2.5 metres 
						in length. Adults acquire a pink color, more prominent in males, giving it its nickname "pink river dolphin". Sexual dimorphism is very evident, with
						males measuring 16% longer and weighing 55% more than females. Like other toothed whales, they have a melon, an organ that is used for bio sonar. 
						The dorsal fin, although short in height, is regarded as long, and the pectoral fins are also large. The fin size, unfused vertebrae, and its relative
						size allow for improved manoeuvrability when navigating flooded forests and capturing prey.
						
					</div>
					<div id="sl5">
					
					</div>
					<div class="dole">
						<p>They have one of the widest ranging diets among toothed whales, and feed on up to 53 different species of fish, 
						such as croakers, catfish, tetras and piranhas. They also consume other animals such as river turtles, aquatic frogs, and freshwater crabs.
						In 2018, this species was ranked by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as endangered, with a declining population.
						Threats include incidental catch in fishing lines, direct hunting for use as fish bait or predator control, damming, and pollution; as with many species,
						habitat loss and continued human development is becoming a greater threat.
						It is the only species of river dolphin kept in captivity, mainly in Venezuela and Europe. It is difficult to train and a high mortality rate 
						is seen among captive individuals.Life expectancy of the Amazon river dolphin in the wild is unknown, but in captivity, the longevity of healthy individuals 
						has been recorded at between 10 and 30 years. However, a 1986 study of the average longevity of this species in captivity in the United States
						is only 33 months. An individual named Baby at the Duisburg Zoo, Germany, lived at least 46 years, spending 45 years, 9 months at the zoo.

						<h1>Macaw</h1>
						<p>Macaw, common name of about 18 species of large colourful parrots native to tropical North and South America. 
						These brightly coloured long-tailed birds are some of the most spectacular parrots in the world. Macaws are classified in the genera Ara,
						Anodorhynchus, Cyanopsitta, Primolius, Orthopsittaca, and Diopsittaca in the family Psittacidae.
						Both male and female macaws look alike, which is uncommon among vividly coloured birds. The cobalt-blue hyacinth macaw 
						(Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus) of Brazil, Bolivia, and Paraguay is the largest of all parrots, measuring 95–100 cm (37.5–39.5 inches) long. 
						The scarlet macaw (Ara macao) is probably the best-known New World parrot. Its brilliant red, yellow, and blue plumage contrasts with a bare
						white face that may blush when the bird is excited. Flying with distinctive slow wingbeats and their long tails trailing, scarlet macaws are 
						most often seen flying to and from roosting and feeding sites in pairs, family groups, or flocks. These gregarious birds can often be heard
						calling in flight, emitting loud metallic screeches.
					</div>
					<div id="sl6">
					
					</div>
					<div class="dole">
						<p>Macaws are easily tamed, and some can mimic sounds. Although these parrots often shriek noisily, gnaw, and occasionally bite with their powerful beaks,
						many local people keep them as pets. A few macaws have survived to 65 years old in captivity.
						Macaws are also exported, often illegally, to supply the worldwide pet trade. This practice, 
						along with land clearing and logging, has contributed to many macaws (as well as other parrots) 
						increasing rarity in the wild. The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species lists several macaws as either 
						endangered or critically endangered. Species at the greatest risk of extinction include the blue-throated macaw 
						(Ara glaucogularis) of northern Bolivia, the great green macaw (Ara ambiguus) of northern Colombia and Central America,
						and Lear’s macaw (Anodorhynchus leari) of Brazil. The most recent confirmed sighting of a non-captive Spix’s macaw 
						(Cyanopsitta spixii)—the bird that inspired the popular films Rio (2011) and Rio 2 (2014)—occurred in 2000, 
						and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and other authorities considered the species extinct in the wild by 2018.
						In addition, ornithologists hold out hope that small populations of the glaucous macaw (Anodorhynchus glaucus), which has been listed by 
						the IUCN as a critically endangered species since 2000, continue to persist; the species was last observed in central South America in the 1960s,
						and several unconfirmed sightings of individuals have been reported since then.

						<h1>Toucan</h1>
						<p>Toucans are Neotropical members of the near passerine bird family Ramphastidae. The Ramphastidae are most closely related to the American barbets. 
						They are brightly marked and have large, often colorful bills. The family includes five genera and over 40 different species.
						Toucans are arboreal and typically lay two to four white eggs in their nests. They make their nests in tree hollows and holes excavated by other animals such as woodpeckers—the 
						toucan bill has very limited use as an excavation tool. When the eggs hatch, the young emerge completely naked, without any down. Toucans are resident breeders and do not migrate.
						Toucans are usually found in pairs or small flocks. They sometimes fence with their bills and wrestle, which scientists hypothesize they do to establish dominance hierarchies.
						In Africa and Asia, hornbills occupy the toucans' ecological niche, an example of convergent evolution.
						Toucans range in size from the lettered aracari (Pteroglossus inscriptus), at 130 g and 29 cm, to the toco toucan (Ramphastos toco),
						at 680 g and 63 cm. Their bodies are short (of comparable size to a crow's) and compact. The tail is rounded and varies in length,
						from half the length to the whole length of the body.</p>
					</div>
					<div id="sl7">
					
					</div>
					<div class="dole">
						<p>   The neck is short and thick. The wings are small, as they are forest-dwelling birds who only need
						to travel short distances, and are often of about the same span as the bill-tip-to-tail-tip measurements of the bird.The legs of the toucan are strong and 
						rather short.
						Their toes are arranged in pairs with the first and fourth toes turned backward. The majority of toucans do not show any sexual dimorphism in 
						their coloration, the genus Selenidera being the most notable exception to this rule (hence their common name, "dichromatic toucanets"). However,
						the bills of female toucans are usually shorter, deeper and sometimes straighter, giving more of a "blocky" impression compared to male bills. The 
						feathers in the genus containing the largest toucans are generally purple, with touches of white, yellow, and scarlet, and black. The underparts of
						the araçaris (smaller toucans) are yellow, crossed by one or more black or red bands. The toucanets have mostly green plumage with blue markings.
						The colorful and large bill, which in some large species measures more than half the length of the body, is the hallmark of toucans. Despite its size,
						the toucan's bill is very light, being composed of bone struts filled with spongy tissue of keratin between them, which take on the structure of a biofoam.
						The bill has forward-facing serrations resembling teeth, which historically led naturalists to believe that toucans captured fish and were primarily 
						carnivorous; today it is known that they eat mostly fruit.

						<h1>Sloth</h1>
						<p>Sloths are a Neotropical group of xenarthran mammals constituting the suborder Folivora, including the extant arboreal tree sloths and extinct 
						terrestrial ground sloths. Noted for their slowness of movement, tree sloths spend most of their lives hanging upside down in the trees of the tropical
						rainforests of South America and Central America. Sloths are considered to be most closely related to anteaters, together making up the xenarthran order
						Pilosa.
						There are six extant sloth species in two genera – Bradypus (three–toed sloths) and Choloepus (two–toed sloths). Despite this traditional naming,
						all sloths have three toes on each rear limb-- although two-toed sloths have only two digits on each forelimb. The two groups of sloths are from 
						different, distantly related families, and are thought to have evolved their morphology via parallel evolution from terrestrial ancestors. Besides the 
						extant species, many species of ground sloths ranging up to the size of elephants (like Megatherium) inhabited both North and South America during the 
						Pleistocene Epoch. However, they became extinct during the Quaternary extinction event around 12,000 years ago, along with most large bodied animals in 
						the New World. 
						</p>
					</div>
					<div id="sl8">
					
					</div>
					<div class="dole">
						<p>The extinction correlates in time with the arrival of humans, but climate change has also been suggested to have contributed. Members of
						an endemic radiation of Caribbean sloths also formerly lived in the Greater Antilles but became extinct after humans settled the archipelago in 
						the mid-Holocene, around 6,000 years ago.
						Sloths are so named because of their very low metabolism and deliberate movements. Sloth, related to slow, literally means "laziness," 
						and their common names in several other languages also mean "lazy" or similar. Their slowness
						permits their low-energy diet of leaves and avoids detection by predatory hawks and cats that hunt by sight. Sloths are almost helpless on
						the ground, but are able to swim. The shaggy coat has grooved hair that is host to symbiotic green algae which camouflage the animal in the
						trees and provide it nutrients. The algae also nourish sloth moths, some species of which exist solely on sloths.The majority of recorded sloth
						deaths in Costa Rica are due to contact with electrical lines and poachers. Their claws also provide another, unexpected deterrent to human hunters; 
						when hanging upside-down in a tree, they are held in place by the claws themselves and often do not fall down even if shot from below.
						Sloths are victims of animal trafficking where they are sold as pets. However, they make very poor pets, as they have such a specialized ecology.

						<h1>Capuchin monkey</h1>
						<p>Capuchin monkey, (genus Cebus), common Central and South American primate found in tropical forests from Nicaragua to Paraguay. Capuchins, 
						considered among the most intelligent of the New World monkeys, are named for their “caps” of hair, which resemble the cowls of Capuchin monks. 
						These monkeys are round-headed and stockily built, with fully haired prehensile tails and opposable thumbs. The body is 30–55 cm (12–22 inches) long, 
						with a tail of about the same length. Coloration ranges from pale to dark brown or black, with white facial markings in some of the four species.
						Capuchins go about in noisy troops consisting of several adults and young. They frequent the tops of tall forest trees but roam throughout the vertical 
						range of their habitat from forest floor to canopy. A troop’s home range covers 50–100 hectares (124–247 acres), and individuals travel about 3 km 
						per day within the range. Very active during the day, these monkeys sometimes forage with squirrel monkeys, feeding on fruit, other vegetable matter,
						and small animals. The capuchin diet is quite broad, encompassing over 95 plant species in some areas, but palm fruits are preferred in particular by 
						capuchins; stronger individuals even smash the nuts to get at the insides. 
						</p>
					</div>
					<div id="sl9">
					
					</div>
					<div class="dole">
						<p>At times, capuchins will raid plantations and farms for oranges, corn, and
						other food.Capuchin monkeys apparently breed at any time of year, although in Central America births are more frequent during the dry season. 
						Gestation takes about six months, and births are usually single. Individual females give birth at intervals of one to two years, and the young 
						reach maturity in three to four years. In captivity, capuchin monkeys are easily trained and have been popularly associated with roving performers 
						such as organ grinders.The genus Cebus consists of five or more species, depending on the taxonomic criteria used, and they are often separated into
						two groups. The crested, or tufted, group includes the brown capuchin (C. apella), in which the crown bears a dark cap of long erect hairs that often
						form tufts or crests. The uncrested, or untufted, group includes the more lightly built white-throated (C. capucinus), white-fronted (C. albifrons), 
						and weeper (C. nigrivittatus) capuchins, in which the crown bears a smooth, dark, and more or less pointed cap.
